# Ubuntu Touch Ports
Title says it all. Porting Ubuntu Touch to some android devices.

## Avaliable devices
Currently, there are none that are finished, but the device that is currently being worked on is the HTC One M7

## Status
One device is "working" but not 100% finished. Still many bugs to be worked out, but it might not be finished for a long time.
